# Ada SPARK Workflow
A demo of best practices for open-source Ada/SPARK development.

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/alire-project/ada_spark_workflow/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=9PZQ67LBPF)](https://codecov.io/gh/alire-project/ada_spark_workflow)

The goal of this repository is to show the best practices for Ada/SPARK open-source development. We will do our best to keep it updated with the latest technologies and services from Alire and GitHub. Donâ€™t hesitate to suggest enhancements in case we missed something interesting.

In this project we use:

 - [`Alire`](https://alire.ada.dev) for dependency management and release publication
 - [`SPARK`](https://learn.adacore.com/courses/intro-to-spark/index.html) and [`GNATprove`](https://github.com/AdaCore/spark2014) for formal verification
 - [`GNAT`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.1.0/gnat_ugn/Warning-Message-Control.html#Warning-Message-Control) built-in checks for static analysis
 - [`AUnit`](https://github.com/AdaCore/aunit) for unit-testing
 - [`GNATcoverage`](https://github.com/AdaCore/gnatcoverage) for source code coverage analysis
 - [`GitHub Actions`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for Continuous Integration

# SPARK proof

Automatic formal verification of the [SPARK
code](https://www.adacore.com/about-spark) in this project is done by the
GNATprove tool. This tool is run as the [Continuous
Integration](#continuous-integration-github-actions) process to ensure that
contributions do not break the proof.

# Static Analysis

The GNAT compiler comes with a lot of static analysis checks built-in. When
using the `validation` [build profile](#build-profiles), Alire enables all the
static analysis checks of GNAT. This provides detection of dead code, unused
variables, or uninitialised data for instance.

# Unit testing

A local Alire crate in the `tests/` folder is used to separate the test
code/framework from the main project. Using a local crate also means that we
can have extra dependencies only for testing:
 - Unit test framework
 - Libraries to read test data (TOML, JSON, etc.)
 - GNATcoverage for [code coverage analysis](#code-coverage)
 - Etc.

This project uses [AUnit](https://github.com/AdaCore/aunit) as the unit testing
framework. The `tests/` crate is both built and run as part of the [Continuous
Integration](#continuous-integration-github-actions) process.

# Code Coverage

GNATcov is used for code coverage analysis on execution of the
[tests](#unit-testing). As part of the [Continuous
Integration](#continuous-integration-github-actions) process, the coverage
analysis is automatically produced and uploaded to an online service called
[codecov.io](https://codecov.io).

With Codecovio you can also have a nice "badge" to display the latest coverage
analysis result in your GitHub `readme.md` file:

# Continuous Integration (GitHub Actions)

For this project we use GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI).
GitHub actions provides virtual machines to build and test the project when new code is added, as well as automated validation of contributions through pull-request checks, or code coverage report with codecovio.

The only thing needed for CI to work is a "workflow" file in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

We extensively commented the workflow file of this repository so if you want to know more about how it works please have a look [here](.github/workflows/main.yml).

# Layout of the Repository

This section provides a quick overview of the different parts of the projects.

## Root Directory
The root directory contains the main library:

 - `alire.toml` manifest file
 - `ada_spark_workflow.gpr` GPRbuild project file (the name matches the Alire crate name)
 - `src` directory that contains the source code for the library
 - `README.md` file in markdown format displayed on the GitHub front page

## `tests` Directory

This sub-directory contains the test-suite for the library. It is an Alire project itself, with a local dependency to the main crate in the root directory, as well as other dependencies that are only required for testing (e.g. `aunit` and `gnatcov`). In this directory we also find an `alire.toml` manifest, a GPRbuild project file and a source directory.

## `.github` Directory

The `.github` directory contains files specific to GitHub features and services. For this project we use GitHub Actions for the Continuous Integration (see [GitHub Actions](#continuous-integration-github-actions) section). But there are more to explore, like templates for opening issues and pull-requests, contributions or code-of-conduct guidelines.

## `share` Directory

This sub-directory contains data files to be installed with the projects.
See [Resources](#resources) section.

# How to Make a Similar project?

This sections provides a list of steps to create a library project with a similar workflow:

## Create a Repository on GitHub

For this step you should follow [the instruction from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo).

We recommend to use a repository name that matches the Alire crate name.
For the example below we will use the name: `my_crate`.

## Setup the Layout

For this step we are going to list a few commands to run on the console.
Please note that we first export variables for the name of the Alire crate a GitHub user login to make the commands more readable.

If you want to make an application project instead of a library, you just have to replace `--lib` by `--bin` in the first `alr init` command.

```console
$ export CRATE_NAME=my_crate
$ export GITHUB_USER_NAME=mygithub
$ git clone https://github.com/${GITHUB_USER_NAME}/${CRATE_NAME}
$ cd ${CRATE_NAME}
$ alr init --in-place --lib ${CRATE_NAME}
$ mkdir tests
$ cd tests
$ alr init --in-place --bin tests
$ alr with ${CRATE_NAME} --use=..
$ alr with aunit
$ alr with gnatcov
```

## Add Continuous Integration

For this step we create a folder for the GitHub Action workflow files and copy the workflow from this repository:
```console
$ mkdir -p .github/workflows/
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alire-project/ada_spark_workflow/main/.github/workflows/main.yml  > .github/workflows/main.yml
```

## Enable Code Coverage Reports

To see the code coverage reports in GitHub pull-requests and have a dedicated page for coverage status, you have to setup the repository in codecovio.

- First create and account and log-in: https://about.codecov.io/
- Click on "Not Yet Setup" (#1 below) to show the list of repositories available.
- Click on "setup repo" (#2 below) to enable codecovio on the new repository
- If the GitHub repository is public, you don't have to do anything more

![](https://files.readme.io/6438f9d-Screen_Shot_2022-04-13_at_9.28.09_AM.png)

Don't forget to add a [coverage status badge](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/status-badges) to your README.md file.

# Resources

Some projects require non-code data files to be provided alongside the library or application executable. It can be images, databases, templates, etc. This is what we call "resources" in the Alire vocabulary.

For this demo project, we have a text file that contains a list of words, a dictionary.

Resources should be placed in the `share/<CRATE_NAME>/` directory of the repository. In addition, the following lines in the GPRbuild project file will make sure resources are installed with the library/application:
```ada
   package Install is
      for Artifacts (".") use ("share");
   end Install;
```

To be able to read the resource files, one needs to get a path to the resource folder. However the location of the resources will not always be the same depending on installation path for instance. The Alire crate `resources` provides an easy way to solve this problem. Here's how to use it:

 1. Add `resources` in the dependencies of you crate:
   ```console
   $ alr with resources
   ```
 2. Instantiate the `Resources` generic package in your code. For examples:
   ```ada
   with Resources;
   with Ada_Spark_Workflow_Config;

   package Ada_SPARK_Workflow.Resources
   is new Standard.Resources (Ada_Spark_Workflow_Config.Crate_Name);
   ```
   Note that you should replace `Ada_Spark_Workflow` with you crate name here.

 3. Get path to resources using this new package:
   ```ada
      Path : constant String := Ada_SPARK_Workflow.Resources.Resource_Path & "/unixdict.txt";

   ```

# Build Profiles

Alire provides an automatic handling of compiler switches. It is based on 3
profiles:
 - Development
 - Validation
 - Release

For each profile a standard set of recommended compiler switches is produced by
Alire and added to the crate configuration project. You can see the crate
configuration project by building a crate (`$ alr build`) and then looking for
a `.gpr` file in the `config/` folder.

By default, the root crate is built with the `Development` profile and the
dependencies are built with the `Release` profile.

There are two ways to override this default:

 - Command line: Use `alr build --release` or `alr build --validation` to
   change the build profile of the root crate. We use `alr build --validation`
   in the [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration-github-actions)
   process to make sure that the code doesn't trigger any errors/warnings and
   passes the coding style standard.

 - Alire manifest (`alire.toml`): To change the build profile of dependencies,
   add a `build-profiles` sections to the root crate manifest. For instance in
   the [local tests crate](#unit-testing) of this project we force use of the
   development profile for the main library:
   ```toml
   [build-profiles]
   ada_spark_workflow = "development"
   ```

# Release workflow

Alire uses the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) system for dependency
resolution. It is very important to understand the basics of this system when
releasing new versions of your crate.

## Choose a version number for a release

Semantic Versioning provides a rule for version numbers:
```
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
    PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
```

The point is that a given crate `A` made to depend on version `1.2.3` of
another crate `B`, can safely be compiled with version any of `B` between
`1.0.0` and `2.0.0`. Alire uses this system to find releases that satisfy all
the dependency requirements of the different crates used.

Let's look at some examples given a current version at `1.2.4-dev`:

 - If we change the prototype of a subprogram in a package specification. For
   instance:
   ```Ada
   procedure Print (Str : String);
   ```
   becomes:
   ```Ada
   procedure Print (Str : String; Indentation : Natural);
   ```
   This is an incompatible API change, we must increase the MAJOR version
   number. Therefore the new release number will be `2.0.0`.

 - If we change the prototype of a subprogram in a package specification, but
   provide a default value. For instance:
   ```Ada
   procedure Print (Str : String; Indentation : Natural := 0);
   ```
   This is a new feature but compatible with the existing API, we must increase
   the MINOR version number. Therefore the new release number will
   be `1.3.0`.

 - If we fix a bug in the body (`.adb`) of a package. The API doesn't change,
   no new features are introduced, we must increase the PATCH version number.
   Therefore the new release will be `1.2.5`.

## Version of main/master/development branch

We recommend using the `-dev` suffix for the version number of the development
branch. For instance: `1.2.4-dev`. This communicates that the crate the code is
not in a release state, API might change, documentation might be lacking, etc.

## Release workflow

First, determine if this is a `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, or `PATCH` release ([see
above](#chose-a-version-number-for-a-release)).

The procedure is different for `MAJOR/MINOR` releases and `PATCH` releases.

### `MAJOR/MINOR` Releases

We recommended using a separate branch for each `MAJOR/MINOR` release, i.e.
when the `MINOR` or `MAJOR` version number is increased:
    - `release/1.0`
    - `release/1.1`
    - `release/2.0`
    - `release/2.1`
    - etc.

The procedure is:
 - From the development branch
 - Create a new branch: `$ git co -b release/X.Y`
 - Update the version number in `alire.toml`
 - Push the branch to the repo: `$ git push`
 - Create a release from the GitHub web interface
 - Make sure the continuous integration checks are ok
 - Take the release manifest automatically produced in the GitHub release and
   contribute it to the Alire index.
 - Update the version number in `alire.toml` on the development branch

Push bug fixes to the MINOR release branch and only update the PATCH number 

### `PATCH` Releases

For `PATCH` release (e.g `1.2.3`) use the corresponding release branch
(`release/1.2`).

The procedure is:
 - Check-out the release branch: `$ git co -b release/1.2 origin/release/1.2`
 - Commit corrective patches or cherry-pick from the development branch
 - Update the `PATCH` version number in `alire.toml`
 - Push the branch to the repo: `$ git push`
 - Create a release from the GitHub web interface
 - Make sure the continuous integration checks are ok
 - Take the release manifest automatically produced in the GitHub release and
   contribute it to the Alire index.
